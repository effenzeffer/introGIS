# Adding a Vector Layer

When opening QGIS for the first time, you will see something like this:

On the image above, I highlighted a few areas and buttons related to layers: The `Add Vector Layer` button, the `Add Raster Layer` button, the `Create New Layer` button, and the `Layers` panel. We will not use the Browser Panel so you can go ahead and close this one clicking on the `X` on the top-right corner of the panel.

Whenever you add a layer to your project, it will be shown in the Layers Panel. Letâ€™s go ahead and open the Census Blocks layer by clicking on the `Add Vector Layer` button. A dialog like this one should open:

Here, click on Browse, go in the BLOCKS folder. You will see several files. Click one the one called "Blocks Study Area.sqlite". When you select it and click on `Open`, you should get this:
