# Layer Properties & Customization

As you can see from the shapes in the layer, this is a polygon vector layer. Each polygon represents a census block, and all together compose the shape of Manhattan. Note that the color of your layer might be different from the one in the images of this tutorial; QGIS chooses layer colors at random when you first open or create one. If for any reason you’d like to change the color of the layer:

* Double-click on the layer name in the `Layers` Panel (“Blocks Study Area”) to bring up the `Layer Properties` box. 
* Click on the `Style` tab on the left side and you’ll be able to customize the look and color of the layer.
* To change the color, click on the colored bar drop-down where it says `Color`. 
* Above it, you’ll notice a `transparency bar`, which can be useful if you want to visualize more than one layer that overlaps. 

Go ahead and experiment with the styles and choose a visualization to your liking.

Since you already are on the `Properties` box, click on `General` so that we can check out the Coordinate Reference System. You will see that this layer’s Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is “Selected CRS (EPSG:4269, NAD83)”. Keep that in mind and close the `Layer Properties` dialog box.
