# Drawing a Polygon

To draw a Polygon:

* Toggle editing mode on by clicking on the `Pencil` icon (second icon from the left in the second toolbar). As you click on it, you will notice that previously greyed-out icons will be enabled. 
* Click on the `Add feature` button (looks like a blob with a small yellow star to the right), which is located two icons to the right of the `Toggle editing` button. Now your cursor is armed to draw. 
* Click on the upper-right corner of the raster image, then on the lower-right, then the lower-left and finally the upper left.
* Right-click to finish drawing.
* A box will pop-up asking you to write an id. Leave it blank and click `OK`.

Don’t worry if you’re not super-precise; for this exercise we don’t need surgeon precision, we’re just practicing, exploring and learning.

A colored square will cover the whole raster image area. Since we don’t need to edit this layer further, click on the `Toggle editing` button again. A dialog will ask you if you want to save the changes, say `yes`.
